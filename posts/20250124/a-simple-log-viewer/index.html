        <h1 class="card-title">A Simple Log Viewer: Venator</h1>
        <p class="sub-title">JANUARY 24, 2025 | RUST, TRACING, OPENTELEMETRY</p>
        <p>
          Over the past six months' worth of free time I have been working on <a href="https://github.com/kmdreko/venator">Venator</a> - an application for visualizing
          log and trace data from the Rust <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing">tracing</a> ecosystem and <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry</a> exporters. Contrary to the title, this
          ended up far from simple but I'm very glad I worked on it.
        </p>
        <div class="card-frame" style="padding: 30% 0%;">
          <img class="card-frame-content" style="filter: brightness(96%);" src="detail1.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          The app has three main views: one for showing events, one for showing spans, and one dedicated for traces
          which correlate spans and events originating from some initial action. On each view it supports complex
          queries for filtering the data based on attributes, source information, or other metrics. Each view also shows
          a graph over time that not only gives you an overview of how the data is distributed, but is also interactive
          for navigating to points of interest. And most importantly, each view includes a table with customizable
          columns and a detailed panel that shows all the data for each entity.
        </p>
        <h2>Rust Tracing</h2>
        <p>
          My motivation for developing Venator was of course out of my own self interests: I wanted some tool to help me
          manage data produced by Rust programs instrumented with the tracing crate. I think tracing is a phenomenal
          library for structured logging, but I was disatisfied with my options for utilizing it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>basic text output does the job for simple things but its not scalable</li>
          <li>plenty of cloud service have nice interfaces but uploading and waiting to view it is too slow for local development</li>
          <li>in-house telemetry solutions exist but are complicated to set up and manage</li>
          <li>the tools that I've found for local development are either shoddy, limited, or simply don't provide the data in the ways that I want</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The name "Venator" is a thematic play off of <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>, which was the closest tool out there but I personally
          didn't find it useful enough for my needs. My main inspiration was <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a> - which I find incredibly useful
          but is also an unreasonable option for local and personal uses.
        </p>
        <div class="card-frame" style="padding: 30% 0%;">
          <img class="card-frame-content" style="filter: brightness(96%);" src="detail2.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          So I built this app to be tailored specifically for me. I built it around the tracing subscriber API which
          simply forwards all events to my UI. Of course the Venator application itself is also written in Rust with the
          UI in <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/">SolidJS</a> and using <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/">Tauri</a> for the integration and platform support.
        </p>
        <h2>OpenTelemetry</h2>
        <p>
          Even though I primarily built it for myself, I still wanted to provide it to
          everyone in hopes that others would also find it useful. In striving to make
          it more generally applicable though, the obvious next question is "why limit
          yourself to tracing when OpenTelemetry is already more prevalent?". So that
          is what I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not throw away my efforts tailoring the app to tracing - I could have
          since using tracing with an OpenTelemetry exporter is an option - but I kept
          it since the tracing-specific flow includes some data that is lost when
          coerced to OpenTelemetry and Rust users using my tracing subscriber would it
          much simpler to setup compared to the same with OpenTelemetry.
        </p>
        <div class="card-frame" style="padding: 30% 0%;">
          <img class="card-frame-content" style="filter: brightness(96%);" src="sample.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          Supporting OpenTelemetry also introduces a lot of unknowns; I have much less
          experience with it and no experience with using the OpenTelemetry SDKs of
          other languages. Of course all should follow the specification but quirks
          happen and users likewise have differing ideas on how certain data should be
          presented within the context of their language. But I'll face those
          challenges as they arise.
