        <h1 class="card-title">A Simple Sketch Effect</h1>
        <p class="sub-title">SEPTEMBER 17, 2019 | C++, OPENGL, GRAPHICS</p>
        <p>
          I had always wanted to make 3D renderings appear hand-made such that they would look similar to traditional
          2D animation. I was finally able to devise a technique that would create the effect I desired using
          tessellation and geometry shaders and a lot of fiddling about. It's not quite realistic but it still evokes
          the feeling I was going for.
        </p>
        <p>Here it is used in a later project:</p>
        <div class="card-frame" style="padding: 28% 0%;">
          <img class="card-frame-content" src="sample.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          While this technique may look familiar, it is not derived from a basic cel shader. I wanted control over
          imperfections seen in traditional animations like imperfect shapes and lines being over-drawn or off-angle.
          Such effects cannot be easily achieved with a cel shader that has only depth and model-distinctions to work
          from. What I ended up developing is much more involved but gives far more variance to the end result.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h2>1. Creating A Box</h2>
        <p>
          I started off with a box since it is enough demonstrate how various situations are handled. The technique
          works initially by drawing simple lines and builds from there. I'll go ahead and note that a purely wireframe
          model is not sufficient for the whole effect, the triangulated faces are used for multiple things in fact.
          More on that later.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Adding Randomness</h2>
        <p>
          As a first step, I adjusted the vertex shader to add some randomness the vertex's position. Its pretty subtle
          since I don't want the lines to be too sporadic, but there's already a bit of underlying complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made sure that the randomness is deterministic and based on both the vertex and a independent "frame" value
          that I only update 12 times a second. Its not very apparent on the 20fps gif above, but I assure you it is
          there. I had built this at 144fps and if I hadn't added the limit, it'd be nothing but a jittery mess.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Splitting Lines</h2>
        <p>
          Then I started treading in unfamiliar territory. I wanted to divide lines into segments so that I add more
          variation and not rely on just the vertex endpoints. I could have just remade the cube with intermediate
          points, but that adds a burden to the model creation and isn't adaptive to how its actually rendered.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is done with a tessellation shader. If you don't know, a tessellation is an OpenGL feature where a
          control shader dictates how a primitive will be subdivided and an evaluation shader that dictates how the
          resultant points are generated. Here, it was pretty easy to take a line and create smaller lines. The trick
          was to make the tessellation dependent on screen space; you may be able to notice that the lines that are
          visibly shorter have less segments. That way, lines further away will stay a single line, and those closer to
          the screen get the additional detail they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a side note, I made sure that the individual segments stay connected in this example, but they don't have
          to be.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Thickening Lines</h2>
        <p>
          OpenGL lines are very limited; they're only good for wireframes since you can't control them much beyond glLineWidth() and glLineStipple().
          So I used a geometry shader to transform those lines into a triangles so that there is width
          that can be manipulated. At this point, they are just rectangles, but I do a bit more with them...
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 0.8em -0.4em;">
          <div class="mini-card-container"><div class="mini-card-frame"><img style="filter: brightness(96%)" class="card-frame-content" src="stage5.gif"/></div></div>
          <div class="mini-card-container"><div class="mini-card-frame"><img style="filter: brightness(96%)" class="card-frame-content" src="stage6.gif"/></div></div>
          <div class="mini-card-container"><div class="mini-card-frame"><img style="filter: brightness(96%)" class="card-frame-content" src="stage7.gif"/></div></div>
          <div class="mini-card-container"><div class="mini-card-frame"><img style="filter: brightness(96%)" class="card-frame-content" src="stage8.gif"/></div></div>
        </div>
        <h2>5. Adding Endcaps</h2>
        <p>
          Since stopping each line abruptly doesn't look that good, I extended the geometry shader to output eight
          vertexes per line instead of four. That way I could add some smaller bits on the ends to make them appear
          rounded. It doesn't look good at larger scales, but it looks convincing at a more modest line width.
        </p>
        <div class="card-frame" style="padding: 16.5% 0%;">
          <img class="card-frame-content" style="filter: brightness(96%)" src="detail1.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          Another side note, this was where I really started caring about it rendering correctly regardless of aspect
          ratio. Since the points are already in clip-space, extending from the points uniformly would appear stretched
          on most displays. I was really frustrated at first trying to account for the aspect ratio in all the required
          places, but I eventually just transformed the points similar to screen-space, did what I had to, and
          transformed them back to create the points. It was much simpler that way.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Using Depth</h2>
        <p>
          This is getting more complicated again; I don't want to draw lines that are obscured by being on the backside
          or even behind other objects. For that, I need depth.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here's where I need the original traingular mesh from the model. I render the model to a separate
          framebuffer without any effects, textures, or even color since all I need is the depth image. I then send that
          to the geometry shader, which does the depth check manually, and can choose to omit that line. A lot of work,
          but now rendered objects look solid.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Detecting Edges</h2>
        <h2>8. Handling Interruptions</h2>
        <h2>Sample Effects</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some quick samples I made for visual effects that you wouldn't be able to achieve with a traditional
          cel shader. Wave effects, ripples, movement lines, smears, etc. By manipulating how each line is drawn, the
          possibilities are endless.
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 0.8em -0.4em;">
          <div class="mini-card-container"><div class="mini-card-frame"><img style="filter: grayscale(100%) brightness(110%)" class="card-frame-content" src="demo1.gif"/></div></div>

          All the demonstrations here can be found on my Twitter along with continued progress and hilarious glitches. I
          mostly post game-development stuff there, but give a follow if you are interested in anything I've shown here.
