        <h1 class="card-title">A Simple Lock-free Ring Buffer</h1>
        <p class="sub-title">OCTOBER 3, 2019 | C++, UTILITY, MULTITHREADING</p>
        <p>
          A while back, I wanted to try my hand at writing a lock-free, multi-producer, multi-consumer ring-buffer. My
          goal was to design a concurrent queue that didn't use any locks, allocations, or thread-count dependent
          structures. The final code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/kmdreko/wilt-ring">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="card-frame" style="padding: 16.5% 0%; filter: brightness(96%);">
          <img class="card-frame-content" src="sample.png"/>
        </div>
        <h2>Basic Design</h2>
        <p>
          For those that don't know, a ring buffer, also called a circular buffer, is a type of queue with a fixed
          maximum allowed size that continually reuses the allocated space to store the elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          When writing a simple non-concurrent ring buffer, it has to have at least four values: two for the start and
          end of the allocated buffer, and two for the start and end of the used space. It is pretty simple to imagine
          an enqueue function would simply check there is space, create a new element at the end of the used space, and
          increment the end marker. A dequeue function would behave similarily with the start of the used space.
        </p>
        <div class="card-frame" style="padding: 16.5% 0%;">
          <img class="card-frame-content" style="filter: brightness(96%)" src="detail1.png"/>
        </div>
        <h2>Naive Lock-free Design</h2>
        <p>
          To account for concurrent operations without using a lock, a bit more bookeeping is required. The solution is
          to add markers to account for the space where elements are added or removed but aren't yet completed. The
          enqueue function would load the end marker for the write space, update it, create the element, and update the
          used space to allow it to be read (all using atomic operations of course).
        </p>
        <div class="card-frame" style="padding: 16.5% 0%;">
          <img class="card-frame-content" style="filter: brightness(96%)" src="detail2.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, there is an issue; the enqueue function cannot update the used space without regard to previous
          writes. Consider the situation where thread 1 has started a write followed by thread 2 but thread 2 finished
          before thread 1, it cannot announce that whole space is available when thread 1 might not be finished. The way
          I decided to work around this was to have operations wait until previous operations are completed by checking
          against the free and used markers. In classifying algorithms, this implementation is still "lock-free" but it
          is not "wait-free" since some threads may have to wait on others.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is actually an even more troubling issue, this particular design suffers from ABA problems.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The ABA problem occurs during synchronization, when a location is read twice, has the same value for both
          reads, and "value is the same" is used to indicate "nothing has changed". However, another thread can execute
          between the two reads and change the value, do other work, then change the value back, thus fooling the first
          thread into thinking "nothing has changed" even though the second thread did work that violates that
          assumption. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem">Wikipedia</a>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The enqueue and dequeue operations both require loading a marker, checking for space, and updating that marker
          via compare-and-swap. The compare-and-swap is intended to verify nothing has changed so it assumes it
          successfully acquired the write space, but that doesn't consider that other operations may have ocurred such
          that there's no space available anymore. This does require the buffer to wrap around on itself, but it can
          happen, especially with limited space. Ring buffers are particularly susceptible to ABA problems because they
          reuse memory by-design.
        </p>
        <h2>Final Design</h2>
        <p>
          The way I solved this required adding variables to keep track of the used and free space and implemented what
          I called a "reserve-commit" system. As part of the enqueue function, before "committing" to the write by
          updating the marker, it would first decrement the free space to "reserve" it. If the compare-and-swap failed,
          it would "un-reserve" by adding back the free space and try again, if it succeeded, it would continue as
          normal. The free space would be incremented later at the end of the dequeue function.
        </p>
        <div class="card-frame" style="padding: 16.5% 0%;">
          <img class="card-frame-content" style="filter: brightness(96%)" src="detail3.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          It may seem like this only adds more variables that don't address the problem. You'd be right, these don't
          help avoid ABA scenarios, but it no longer matters. The issue that the ABA problem caused was the potential to
          not have space to work with, but with this change the space is already "reserved", so there will always be
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having these additional variables also removes the ambiguity where a full buffer and an empty buffer end up
          looking the same.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>
          A concurrent queue without allocations or locks! It must be very fast, right? Well...
        </p>
        <p>
          It performs pretty terribly. I wasn't super interested in performance initially, but I did get it running in
          the <a href="https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue">moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue</a> benchmarks to see
          how it did. It performed well in the single-producer-single-consumer scenarios, and it was fine in the
          two-producers-two-consumers scenarios, but any more threads and the performance dropped off dramatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for the poor performance is primarily due to the number of atomic operations that are required.
          They aren't free and this design needs six for each enqueue or dequeue operation. This magnifies the
          performance impact of any thread contention on the ring buffer. A high-quality concurrent queue would strive
          to keep the atomic operations to a minimum. So I don't recommend using it in any real application.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Even though what I built didn't end up being useful, I was really pleased with the result. I finally got
          around to understanding the C++ various memory order behaviours. I strengthened by understanding of lock-free
          algorithms. I discovered first-hand that ring buffers aren't that great for concurrent queues. And I confirmed
          the convential wisdom of "don't roll your own", or if you do, at least test it first.
